//Instructions:
//For the coding challenge, a lot of our data is time-based data. We have events which have distinct start times and end times. For instance, our swings have a lot of data associated with them and have a defined start time and end time in our model. The same can be said of videos and batting sessions. In the app challenge, I would like you to set up some sample data types that have a start time, end time, and some other piece of data. Then, with some list of test data, given a particular time - return the list of events which contain that time. The user interface and exact data types are entirely up to you - I'm interested to see how you approach this and what your code looks like to accomplish this.
